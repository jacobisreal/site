<h1><font color="blue">About Me</font></h1>
<p><img src="http://i564.photobucket.com/albums/ss90/jacobisreal/jacob.eiler.gif" border="0" align="left" height="50%" width="25%" alt=" photo jacob.eiler.gif"/>My name is Jacob and I reside in beautiful Houston, Texas.  I'm 38 years old and work as a technical support representative for a large Internet Service Provider.  I have a dog and a roommate, and I love to cook!  My favorite foods are mediterranean food and italian (basically pizza and pasta).  I am a student at CoderCamps and will graduate in October of this year.  I'm excited to have some extra education and a certification under my belt!</p>
<h1><font color="green">My Background</font></h1>
<p>I have studied at several Universities, including Indiana Wesleyan University, American Intercontinental University, and Colorado Technical University.  I am about 20 credit hours away from a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems.  I am an ordained minister, although I do not preach at a church.  I specialize in counseling and outreach.  I am a cancer survivor and 9/11 attack survivor, activist, speaker, writer, and singer.</p>
<h1><font color="purple">Why I Write Code</font></h1>
<p>Since I was a child, computer have been an escape from the world around me.  Rather than some less productive past-times, I chose at an early age to utilize computers.  When I learned that I could basically make a computer do whatever I want if I spoke its language, I decided to learn the BASIC programming language.  I was 10 years old.  My first program was a phone book application that stored my friends' phone numbers.  Keep in mind, this was in the early 90s, and computer storage was limited to tape cassettes.  I learned that if I played the tape, it sounded like what most people would call the "dial-up" sound and I instantly fell in love with the song of data (not to mention it annoyed the hell out of my siblings!).</p>
